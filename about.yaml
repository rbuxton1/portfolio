  content: 'I am a third year computer science student at the Univeristy of Colorado Denver. I enjoy creating meaningful experiences for users and writing software to make peoples lives easier. When I am not at my computer, I can be found adventuring the Colorado Rockies in my little Beetle.<div class="w3-center w3-padding"><img src="/img/beetle_boy.jpg" class="w3-image"></div>'
- title: What have I done?
  content: A lot! Heres a short list of some of my favorite projects I've worked on <ul> <li><a href="https://vg.ryanbuxton.com"> Virtual Graffiti</a> - This is an on going effort to make an anonymous social media like platform where users posts are fixed to specific GPS coordinates. The demo does currently work, albeit with some bugs!</li> <li><a href="http://webtour.comcastmediatechcenter.org/">CEDC Web Tour</a> - This was a fun project at the CMTC to create a freeform tour of the College of Engineering, Design, and Computing at UC Denver. For an added bit of fun, you can actually find me in most of the photos!</li> <li><a href="https://astraldroid.com/">Astral Droid</a> - This was another incredibly fun project I worked where the goal was to create a unique augmented reality game. Some of the technology we developed in this project ended up winning second place in <a href="https://engineering.ucdenver.edu/current-students/lewis-award">The Lewis Family Award.</a></li> </ul> I of course have plenty more projects, all visable on <a href="https://github.com/rbuxton1">my GitHub!</a>
